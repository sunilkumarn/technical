Haven't Written any thing for  quite some time now. It was last november that i actually sat down to write something. Started off my professional career then and obviously was busy with work and stuff. Need to get back to writing stuff, little and bigger stuffs that i have learnt while working. In between i have fallen in love with a a new language - Ruby, the popular choice for web apps these days.  From a person who never had any kind of fondness for OOP, i have started loving to talk about about objects and classes. Learnt the difference between fun coding and professional coding. These 6-8 months has really been a learning curve for me and i really do hope that my following posts would reflect that.
