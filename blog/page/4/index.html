  <div class="entry-content"><p>When writing long codes , its important that , as a programmer , you write your code in the best possible structure that is readable to others. Most languages can be written in different styles, and one may be better than the other. Choosing an appropriate coding style is important so that reading your code is not itching to the eyes.
<strong>PEP8</strong> has emerged as the style guide that most codes adhere to. The most important points that needs to be followed are:
1)Use 4-space indentation and no tabs .</p>

<p>2)Use blank lines to separate functions and classes and large blocks of code within functions</p>

<p>3)Use comments when possible</p>

<p>4)Use docstrings in classes and functions.</p>

<p>5)Use spaces around operators and commas e.g     &mdash;&mdash;&ndash;      &lsquo;c = a + b&rsquo;</p>

<p>6)Naming your classes and functions consistently. Always use &lsquo;self&rsquo; as the name for the first argument a method in the class.</p>

<p>7)Wrap lines so that they don&rsquo;t exceed 79 characters.</p>

<p>Try using all of the above listed particulars and make you code eye-pleasing and obviously easy to understand.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a python programmer, i feel it necessary to mention about the library search path in python. Python looks in several places in your system when we try and import a module in python.
Precisely , it searches in all directories mentioned in sys.path. Just try and see the directories in sys.path.</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>import sys
<strong>sys.path</strong>
This returns you a list of the directories where python does a &lsquo;look in&rsquo; to import your module. This list may vary from system to system and depends on the python version that you use.For me, sys.path is :</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>[&lsquo;&rsquo;, &lsquo;/usr/lib/python2.5&rsquo;, &lsquo;/usr/lib/python2.5/plat-linux2&rsquo;, &lsquo;/usr/lib/python2.5/lib-tk&rsquo;, &lsquo;/usr/lib/python2.5/lib-dynload&rsquo;, &lsquo;/usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages&rsquo;, &lsquo;/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages&rsquo;, &lsquo;/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/Numeric&rsquo;, &lsquo;/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/PIL&rsquo;, &lsquo;/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/gst-0.10&rsquo;, &lsquo;/var/lib/python-support/python2.5&rsquo;, &lsquo;/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/gtk-2.0&rsquo;, &lsquo;/var/lib/python-support/python2.5/gtk-2.0&rsquo;]</p>

<p>A few points about sys.path:</p>

<p>**Importing the sys module makes all the attributes and functions of the module available to you.</p>

<p>sys.path as i mentioned gives you the current search path.</p>

<p>You could add a new directory to the python path by appending the list &lsquo;sys.path&rsquo;
sys.path.append(/my_directory/my_setup)**
Again view sys.path and you will find the directory mentioned above in the new search path.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just like most other languages , Python also has functions in it. Lets go through some of the aspects of functions in python.</p>

<p><strong>def my_function(var1,var):</strong>
This is how you declare a function in Python.
The keyword def, the function name ,the arguments separeted by commas in parenthesis. Its important to understand that functions in python specify no return type. Each and every function returns something. Either the value returned or else &lsquo;none&rsquo; , the python &lsquo;null value&rsquo;. The arguments dont specify a type either , the type is made out from the values that are passed in .
Python is a :
<strong>dynamically typed language</strong>: The types are discovered at run time.
<strong>strongly typed language</strong>: One particular type cannot converted to another type without explicit type conversion.</p>

<p><strong>Higher order functions in python:</strong> Functions that operate on other functions, (functions that can take other functions as its arguments).
Eg: filter(my_function,list_1)   is a built in higher order function , which takes the function &lsquo;my_function&rsquo; as one of its arguments.</p>

<p><strong>Functions in python are first class:</strong>
Consider :
def my_function2(var1):
We have defined a function &lsquo;my_function2&rsquo;
Now we could do this:
var=my_function.
Now try printing the value of &lsquo;var&rsquo;
Its the address of the function &lsquo;my_function2&rsquo; that will be printed because assigning a function name to a variable assigns it address to the variable.
Now we could invoke the function as:
var(my_parameter)
Just check out the glob module in python (/usr/lib/python2.5/glob.py) for a good example of the first class nature of functions in python.
Function composition is perhaps the best way to explain the fact that function are first class in python.
def f(my_funct):</p>

<p>def g(x):</p>

<p>def compose (f(g(x))): &mdash;&mdash;&ndash; function composition&hellip;.functions are passed in as variables to other functions.
The way variables are used in function in also important .  A good knowledge of the use of <a href="http://sunilkumarn.wordpress.com/2010/09/05/local-and-global-variables-in-python/">local and global variables</a> are required to avoid any kind of misperception  while using variables in python.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lets see the working of global and local variables in python with the help of a few small examples: What you need to understand is that variables that are declared inside functions are local to that functions (cannot be accessed from outside the function), whereas variables that are declared outside the function are global to that function , they can be accessed within the function.</p>

<p>_>>>a=1</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>def func():
&hellip;    print a
&hellip;    a=10
&hellip;
func()_
would produce an error as:
<strong>UnboundLocalError: local variable &lsquo;a&rsquo; referenced before assignment.</strong>
This is because the local variable &lsquo;a&rsquo; is used in the &lsquo;print&rsquo; statement before it is being assigned a value.
However ,</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>_>>>a=1</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>def func():
&hellip;    global a
&hellip;    print a
&hellip;    a=10
&hellip;  <br/>
func()_
wouldn&rsquo;t print an error of that sort.
Note the use of the keyword <strong>&lsquo; global&rsquo; </strong>. This keyword indicates that the variable &lsquo;a&rsquo; that is being printed is a global variable. The python interpreter understands that there is a variable &lsquo;a&rsquo; that has been assigned to &lsquo;1&rsquo; outside the function and hence prints the value &lsquo;1&rsquo;.</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>Now do the following:</p>

<p>_>>>a=1</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>def func():
&hellip;    global a
&hellip;    print a
&hellip;    a=10
&hellip;    print a
func()_
The result would be:
1
10
Now try and print the value of &lsquo;a&rsquo;.
The value printed would be:
&lsquo;10&rsquo;
This is because the value of the variable &lsquo;a&rsquo; has been changed to 10 by the function
&lsquo;func&rsquo; because &lsquo;a&rsquo; has been declared as a global variable in the function &lsquo;func&rsquo;.</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>Now do :
_>>>def func():
&hellip;    print b
&hellip;    b=10
&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>print b _
would result in an error :
<strong>NameError: name &lsquo;b&rsquo; is not defined</strong></p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>because no variable &lsquo;b&rsquo; has been assigned a value outside the function. The variable &lsquo;b&rsquo; used in the function &lsquo;func&rsquo; is local to that function and cannot be accessed from that outside the function, that is , the variable &lsquo;b&rsquo; is <strong>local</strong> to the function.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Version control is a system that records changes to your files and allows to view specific versions of a file or set of files.VCS is used so that you don&rsquo;t screw up your files or your entire project as a result of the silly , careless mistakes that you have made.
Many people do their own version control by copying their files to another directory.This is a quite simple and easy approach if you are careful enough so that you won&rsquo;t agonize by doing something disastrous so that you may lose all your stuff later.Therefore keeping in mind that such things can happen ,after all we are all humans, we use version control systems.</p>

<p><em>Centralized VCS and Distributed VCS.</em>
<strong>Centralized VCS </strong>
CVCS includes a single server that contains different versions of the files and the clients could check into that.The major advantage of this system is that administrators have fine grained control over whats happening ,but it has serious drawbacks as well. They are:
Single point of storage if crash would be fatal.
The clients could pull anything from the repository but they need a <strong>commit access </strong>to push something into it.This might lead to a client getting frustrated if he/she has not been granted a &lsquo;commit access&rsquo;  even after working for a longer period of time. Also there might something political issues related to administration.</p>

<p><strong>Distributed VCS.</strong>
In DVCS ,you could push data into the repository with the same ease with which you could pull from it. All the repositories are at the same level and therefore we could collaborate with any of the repositories.Examples of DVCS are Git , mercurial , bazaar..etc&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Shebang</strong>(also known as &lsquo;hashbang&rsquo;) refers to the characters #! when they are the first two characters (occurring at the left most corner, i.e the beginning of the very first line) of your script. The particular line that contains the shebang is the shebang line in your script.
Now what&rsquo;s shebang meant to do.?
In a unix-like operating system , <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loader_(computing">the program loader</a>) (part of the operating system thats responsible for loading programs) finds the presence of these two characters(#!) , identifies it as a script and tries to execute it with the interpreter that will be specified using the remaining lines of the script.
For example consider writing a shebang line for a python script..
First and foremost you need to find the location of the interpreter for that particular script&hellip;
<strong>$which python
/usr/bin/python</strong>
Therefore&hellip;the shebang line should be set as&hellip;
<strong>#! /usr/bin/python</strong>
Specifying the shebang line would execute your script as follows:
./&lsquo;script name&rsquo;.py       instead of doing     &lsquo;python &#8216;script name&rsquo;.py&#8217;
You could try out the use of shebang lines for any of the following types of scripts
&lsquo;werbel&rsquo;, &lsquo;tinypy&rsquo; ,&lsquo;perl&rsquo;&hellip;..and many more&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><pre><code>    Compare python with some of the other languages that are familiar to many of you. The obvious difference that will be caught by you , is the fact that python code, for the same program ,is much shorter than codes written in some of your favorite languages like C ,Java etc.
</code></pre>

<p>Understanding the essence of python programming would help you write shorter and interesting codes  and are easier to understand. Lets just have a look into some of the core points that need to be followed so that your python program becomes short and effective.</p>

<pre><code>    First and foremost, you need to understand the fact that python has got a huge library with functions for almost every activity you would need frequently. The only thing you need to do is to identify whether a function is present that would handle your case and then call the function .There are lots of built in functions that we could call. Other functions that reside in certain modules can also be invoked after the module containing the function has been imported.
</code></pre>

<p> As an example , consider the following:</p>

<pre><code>        **map(sqr,range(1,100)):**

    'map' is a built -in higher order function that takes two or more arguments and returns you a list,'range' is another built-in which would return a list containing all the elements from the starting element up to the ending element.

    This particular function returns a list of squares of all numbers from 1 up to 99 using a single line code. Compare this to a C code to find the squares of this many numbers,certainly ,a single line code wouldn't do that for you.

    Python has got a large collection of such built ins which includes functions like 'filter','reduce','hex','cmp' and many more.

    Python has got many more functions that are defined in different modules:To use those functions , you just need to import those modules and invoke them. Some of the most commonly invoked ones are :
    **Module 're**' for pattern matching. Contains power full functions like findall' , search' , 'match' etc.
    **Module 'os'** for operating system services. Includes functions 'mkdir' , 'chdir' ,' path.join,' path.abspath'' etc.
    **Module 'shutil'** for shell utilities like copying files.

    **Module 'urllib'** for dealing with 'URLs'.

    **Module 'sys**' :sys.argv[index] would return the input given on the command line at position 'index.'

    Identifying the correct functions that are present in these and more modules in python  would result in much shorter code length. 

 A proper knowledge about the use of sequences and variables would do no harm in our purpose of decreasing the code size.

Consider the code to swap the values of two variables. In other languages you would write:
temp=a:
a=b:
b=temp:

Once again, in python all you need is a single line code :

**a,b=b,a**
</code></pre>

<p> The logic behind whats happening is to be understood. Consider the right hand side of the expression -variables are packed into a tuple. On the left hand side, the tuple is unpacked and the values are entered into the variables. Thus the values are swapped in a single line as opposed to three lines taken in other languages.</p>

<pre><code>Use of generator expressions is another way to reduce your code size.
Consider:
xvec=[10,20,30]
yvec=[30,40,50]
</code></pre>

<p>The expression <strong>sum(x*y for x,y in zip(xvec,yvec)) </strong>gives you the dot product of xvec and yvec in a single step where &lsquo;sum&rsquo; is another built in function. Think of writing a C code instead of this and the number of writing you would take.</p>

<pre><code>There are many more such tricks that would decrease the code size considerably . Slicing of lists , usage of the appropriate sequences are all important in producing a short and elegant code. Obviously,the fact remains that to understand the methodology behind decreasing the code size is to keep on coding ,understanding the definitions of the functions and identifying where to use them. But again, compressing your code size heavily might result in your code being hard to digest by others, specially those beginners trying to understand a python code. Therefore its important to develop a skill where you would maintain a balance between decreasing the code size and the readability of your code. This can be achieved only through rigorous coding.
</code></pre>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In C, once the memory allocated becomes garbage , that chunk of memory is gone wasted. Nothing more is possible on it.
Consider
<strong>int a[10];</strong>
Some amount of memory would be allocated for the array &lsquo;a&rsquo;. Now if do a=&lsquo;some value&rsquo; , the memory that was allocated to the array becomes garbage because &lsquo;a&rsquo; no longer uses it as it is pointing to something else now. The memory is gone wasted and is no more usable.
The bugs that create loss of memory are hard to detect as well ,simply because of the fact that they cannot be seen. Its only after executing the particular code for some amount of times that you might actually get to see the effects of the bug .By the time your system may have crashed.</p>

<p>In python ,the interpreter is smart enough to do &lsquo;garbage collection&rsquo;. That is the memory which is unused is collected by the interpreter and is not gone wasted. The process of garbage collection is done by using a method called ref counting. Understand ref counting as :
<strong>Consider a=[1,2,3]</strong>
&lsquo;a&rsquo; points to a particular block of memory. At the end of the block of memory ,there would be a count that indicates the number of variables that point to the same block of memory. So now the count would be 1.</p>

<p>Now if we do,</p>

<p>b=a&hellip;&hellip;means that now b points to same block of memory. Therefore the count becomes 2.</p>

<p>Now consider doing</p>

<p>b=0.</p>

<p>The count in the block of memory where b was pointing earlier reduces by 1. , hence count is now 1.
Do</p>

<p>&lsquo;a=0&rsquo;</p>

<p>and the count in that block becomes 0.Now the python interpreter can allot the chunk of memory to some other variable as it may feel. The significant thing that you need to understand is the fact that the memory is not gone wasted as in C .</p>

<p>Garbage collection keeps track of the variables that point to a block of memory and collects the unused memory accordingly. There is never a shortage of memory space. But there are obvious disadvantages with the process of garbage collection.</p>

<p>One drawback , as you would except would be the matter of speed which would decrease.
But the more significant drawback would be the <strong>non-deterministic behavior</strong> of the interpreter.
Consider the two statements.
 .i=0
 .j=0
You would expect the statement j=0 to be executed immediately after the statement i=0 has been executed. But as a result of this process of garbage collection ,this is not a guarantee. There might be a certain time delay in executing the second statement if the interpreter feels like doing some &lsquo;garbage collection&rsquo; after the first statement has been executed . This results in the delay.</p>

<p>Therefore its clear that its not best to use python over languages like C when it comes to real time systems.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Consider the function definition:
<strong>def mapp(fun,first,*second): </strong>     (A function that is defined to implement the properties of the &lsquo;map&rsquo; function</p>

<p>Here the function &lsquo;mapp&rsquo; consists of three arguments passed to it. Out of this ,the third argument (second) is the arbitrary argument list. The argument is itself optional and can be passed with different lists or tuples ranging from zero to any number of lists.
The length of the arbitrary listed argument would be zero if no arguments are passed to it.(len(second)=0).</p>

<p>The call to the above function would be as follows:
mapp(sqr,a)</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>mapp(add,a,b,c)</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p> mapp(mul,a,b)</p>

<p>where a,b,c are any lists.
and &lsquo;sqr&rsquo;,&lsquo;add&rsquo;,&lsquo;mul&rsquo; are functions.</p>

<p>Suppose the call to the function be
mapp(mul,a,b,c)</p>

<p>The lists b,c are passed as arguments to the function &lsquo;mapp&rsquo; via the formal parameter &lsquo;second&rsquo; (arbitrary listed argument).
Now     second[0]=b</p>

<pre><code>second[1]=c.

  <div class="entry-content"><pre><code>Coming from C ,a programming language where you might come across lot of un-expectencies while coding, python might be termed as 'lot easier' to deal with for a beginner especially. For those who have programmed in C,python provides you with the great advantage of 'not' having to get into the system specifications such as 'memory and bit' manipulations. Ask those C programmers who would always say that the biggest challenge they have come across in C as a beginner is while they have dealt with pointers as if they are being taunted . Luckily ,specially for the starters ,python doesn't require you to get into the memory allocation details and other stuff. All you need to do is to write your efficient code and wait for the result and most of the time the output you get wont give you a shock.

You could create a long list of points that might attract you to do a bit of coding in Python although C obviously has its own standouts. Some of them may be noted.

Python follows the Object oriented Programming paradigm whereas C follows Imperative programming paradigm.

Python has got a really large library as compared to C and a huge number of really powerful and useful built in functions.

Python code ,at first sight looks a lot more tidy than C because of its compulsory indentation requirement. You might know that this is not a necessity in C.

Python codes can be slower than corresponding C codes. Because python performs an 'out-of-range' checking for each iteration while looping ,the code becomes a lot more slower. This check has its own advantage though. Programmers in C would no that trying to access a location outside the allocation of an array would cause disastrous results.Python also performs the process of [garbage collection](http://sunilkumarn.wordpress.com/2010/09/02/garbage-collection-in-python/) which again decreases the execution speed.

The use of 'for loop' in Python is entirely different from that in C. The variable used is auto incremented and its important not to try and modify the loop variable of the 'for' loop.

There are no type declarations in python as is necessary in C.

    Python does not support in-line assignment as in C. Therefore there is no chance of accidently assigning the value to a variable that you thought you were comparing.i.e 'if a=5' would just produce an error in Python whereas in C this would make the value of a equal to 5.

One of the major differences between python and C is that you wont get to play with pointers in python. Memory manipulation by the programmer is not required in Python as in C. Almost all the such activities done in C with the use of pointers can be done with sequences and associative arrays in python.

The variables used in python would result in an error without making an appropriate assignment. This proves really beneficial because unassigned variables can trouble you leading even up to segmentation faults in C.

Implementation of the 'stack' data structure becomes a lot more easier in python than in C. The implementation of 'queue' also becomes relatively easier. The python built-ins ;insert','append' etc helps in the purpose.

Another important feature of python is the use of sequences 'lists' , 'tuples',strings' and the use of Associative arrays. and their different manipulations. This helps programmers to do almost anything that can imagine of with the data stored.

Most importantly, python code is a lot more short than its  corresponding C code. Programs that may take up to a few lines in a normal C code would give you the result in about 1-2 lines of coding in Python.
