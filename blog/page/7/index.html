  <div class="entry-content"><p>A file is a sequence of characters. A few commands and knowledge that may help in dealing with files and directories in UNIX are the following.
The &lsquo;ls&rsquo; commands and its variations :
The &lsquo;du&rsquo; command and its variations
The command used to change the permissions – &lsquo;chmod&rsquo;.
A look into these commands
ls command gives a listing of all the files that are present in the current directory.
The &lsquo;ls -l&rsquo; is used to provide a detailed listing of the files that are present.
For eg. If you type the command &lsquo;ls -l&rsquo; the results be will produced as
-rw-r&mdash;r&mdash; 1 root root 856 2010-08-03 20:15 delete.c</p>

<p>-rw-r&mdash;r&mdash; 1 root root 868 2010-08-03 08:19 line.c</p>

<p>where line.c and delete.c are the two files present in the directory.
The other variations of the command include ls-u,ls-t etc
The &lsquo;du&rsquo; (disk usage)provides information about the usage of the disk.
The command &lsquo;du -a&rsquo; is used to provide disk informations about even the files of subdirectories.
 The &lsquo;du-a|grep line.c&rsquo;
provides the details about the file &lsquo;line.c&rsquo;.
&lsquo;chmod&rsquo; is the command that is used to change permissions. The permissions can be changed by the superuser.
Consider the following permissions:
-rwxrwxrwx     &ndash;    indicates that the owner,the group and the other users of the system can all read&reg;,write(w)and execute(x) the file of which the permission has be shown.
Inorder to change the permission , the &lsquo;chmod&rsquo; command is used.
For eg. &lsquo;chmod 666  file&rsquo;
indicates that the file can be read and written by all the three categories of users mentioned above.
The octal values have their meanings as
4-indicates that the file can be read
2-file can be written
1-file can be executed
therefore &lsquo;chmod 444 file&rsquo; would set the permissions of the file to read only for all the  categories of users.
6 6 6 indicates(4+2 4+2 4+2) for the three users.)
Now do &lsquo;ls -l&rsquo; and you will see the permissions as
-r&mdash;r&mdash;r&mdash;.
&lsquo;+&rsquo; is used to turn a permission on   and &lsquo;&ndash;&rsquo; to turn it off.
The command &lsquo;chmod +w file&rsquo; enables write permissions for the file
and &lsquo;chmod -x file&rsquo; turns off the execute permissions for the file.
The permissions of the file can be viewed using the &lsquo;ls -l&rsquo; command stated before. The permissions of the directory cab also be set and viewed using the &lsquo;ls -ld&rsquo; command.
The &lsquo;ln&rsquo;,&lsquo;cp&rsquo;,&lsquo;mv&rsquo; commands are used in UNIX for slightly different uses.
The &lsquo;ln command creates a link to the file. Therefore the same file can be accessed using the two file names. The syntax is as follows:
&#8216;ln filename filename1&rsquo;
You would obtain another link to the file named &lsquo;filename&rsquo; by the name of &lsquo;filename1&rsquo;:
The change made to original file would reflect in the other as well. You could see that with help of the &lsquo;ls -i&rsquo; (command that indicates the &lsquo;i-number&rsquo; of the file)that the two files that are linked are having the same i-number.
&lsquo;cp&rsquo; command is used to make the copy and the &lsquo;mv&rsquo; command is used to move or rename files.
The command &lsquo;mv filename1 filenname2&hellip;&hellip; destination directory&rsquo; is used to move several files together to the destination directory.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Consider the statement
char c=&lsquo;5&rsquo;
printf(“%d”,c);
The result that will be printed is 53, which is the integer value of the character constant &lsquo;5&rsquo; ,stored in the machine.
Now if we need to get 5 as the output,we need to use “%c” in &lsquo;printf&rsquo;.
Character constants are integers written as one character within single  quotes.
Now consider :
int c=getchar();
printf(“%d”,c);
The result would be the integer value representation of the entered character.
“%c” in &lsquo;printf&rsquo; would print the character in the terminal.
Now consider the case of a character array
char array[]={5,6,7}.
If we print array[0],using “%d”, then &lsquo;5&rsquo; would be printed. Nothing would be printed if “%c” is used in the printf statement.
Here 5 itself is a constant. Now if we need to enter alphabets into a character and print it we need to do the following:
char array[]={&lsquo;a&rsquo;,&lsquo;b&rsquo;,&lsquo;c&rsquo;};
Now print it using “%c”.The alphabets would be printed.
If printed using “%d”, then the integer representations would be printed(97,98,99).The characters that entered into a character array are stored as integers inside the array.
If we do
char array[]={a,b,c}
The result would be an error as such:
&lsquo;a&rsquo; undeclared&hellip;.&lsquo;c&rsquo; undeclared&hellip;etc..</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some of the most common errors that are produced in a program are caused due to the lack of interest ensuring that the data types used are correct. Some of these errors will be displayed while some will not and its up to the user to search the program and find out whats wrong with it. Therefore the user must be very careful while using the type of the functions, the variables that are used etc&hellip;An example below shows the use of the data type of the functions and variables&hellip;
Consider a program which is used perform the functions of a calculator: The functions that are used in the program are the follows:
push(),pop(),getop(),atof(),main()(These are just the function names)
 Now each of these functions have got a specific task.
The &lsquo;getop&rsquo; function is used to get the character that is entered by the user. The value that will be returned by the function would be of an integer type:
hence <strong>&lsquo;Int getop( char []);&rsquo;</strong> (A string is passed as the parameter)
&lsquo;push&rsquo; is used to enter a value into the stack. The value would be of type &lsquo;double&rsquo;. Hence the argument that is passed to the function &lsquo;push&rsquo; would be of type &lsquo;double&rsquo;. Nothing is returned by &lsquo;push&rsquo;.
Hence &lsquo;<strong>void push(double);</strong>&rsquo;
&lsquo;pop&rsquo; returns a double value and nothing is passed to the &lsquo;pop&rsquo; as an argument because it just takes up the value from the array(array[] ,declared externally).
Hence<strong> &lsquo;double pop(void)&rsquo;</strong>
&lsquo;atof&rsquo; takes the string as the argument and returns a double value:
hence &lsquo;<strong>double atof(char[]);&rsquo;</strong>
The data type of &lsquo;array[]&rsquo; should again be double because it handles &lsquo;double&rsquo; values.
Now the program looks like this:</p>

<p> #include
 #define MAX 50
 int getop(char s[]);
 double atof(char s[]);
 void push(double);
 double pop(void);
 double arr[MAX];
 int top=0;
 main()</p>

<p> Now if the data types of any of the above declarations are not according to the problem you wouldn&rsquo;t get the expected results.
For example if the data type of array[] is not double(say integer) , you would get the result as some meaningless value. Same is the case with all of the above functions and variables declared.
For the purpose of add,subtract,multiply and divide the use of &lsquo;double&rsquo; values is good(infact a necessity if you want the exact output).
But when the &lsquo;%&rsquo;(modulus) operator is used ,then the problem arises. If the modulus operator is used with two double values the resulting error would be as follows:
<strong> error: invalid operands to binary % (have ‘double’ and ‘double’) :</strong>
Hence the values needs to be converted to type &lsquo;int&rsquo;.
Int op=pop();
push((int)pop()%op);
The type is converted from double into int. Now since pop returns a double value, this will again be converted back to a double value.</p>

<p>A note on External variables: Here array[] and top are declared as external variables and so can be accessed by the functions that are mentioned. Hence these values need not be passed as an argument to the functions. The fact that is to be taken into account that is that when external variables are used , the variable names cannot be changed within a function as is the case while passing arguments.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While compiling C programs we might often come across errors,messages and unexpected results as our output.. The following shows a few of those :
Sometimes u might get certain unexpected values like -1098763408 as your result.
This might be due to the fact that u may not have initialized the variable used in the expression producing the result to a starting value(say i=0).
The same doing (i.e a variable not set to its initial value) might produce a &lsquo;segmentation fault&rsquo; in the program. Segmentation fault may also be produced due to the fact that the alloted size for the particular string array is less than what you have just tried to fill in.
For eg. If</p>

<h1>define MAX 10</h1>

<p>char string[MAX];
The size is 10.Now if u try to fill in more than 10 characters a case of segmentation fault might occur.
Another case exists where you might get an error as the following one:
 error: conflicting types for ‘some_function_name’
This might be because of the fact that the function name that you have used is the name of the function that is already present in one of the header files.
For common functions like &lsquo;strlen&rsquo; ,&lsquo;strcat&rsquo; etc this might not occur because we wont use them as our function names. But this might occur sometimes for certain function names that we may not be familiar with.
For eg. The error message would be displayed when you use function names as
&lsquo;index&rsquo; or &lsquo;remove&rsquo; etc&hellip;even if your declaration,definition and the call might be correct.
Don&rsquo;t keep pondering over it,you just need to change your function name to another one that does not exist in the system&rsquo;s headers. For eg..change &lsquo;the name index&rsquo; to &lsquo;ind&rsquo; or something else.</p>

<p>Another common case where you may not obtain the result might be because of an error in the &lsquo;printf&rsquo; statement. For eg you may have used “%d” to print a float value even though “%f”should have been be used.</p>

<p>It is important to check that the type of 1)the called function and 2) the variable that is used in the calling function in order to receive the value returned from the called function has to be same .If this is not the case ,an error would be produced (that would happen only if both the functions are in the same source file. But if the functions are in different source files, then the case becomes more complicated because the error would not be displayed.
In case you find that the output you obtain has got some definite value but is meaningless according to the problem, then a solution might to have a look through all the data types used in the program and see if its appropriate and matching. Such cases might occur in programs involving many functions</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Local variables are variables that come into existence only when the function is called and disappears thereafter whereas external variables are accessible to all functions of the program.
To illustrate the difference between these two kinds of variables ,consider a function <strong>‘getline()’ </strong>
At first we consider the case where local variables are used. The call and the function definition in this case would be as follows:
Function call:
<strong>getline(line,MAXLENGTH);</strong>
Function definition:
<strong>int getline(char s[],int lim)
{
}
</strong>Here there is a requirement to pass the arguments from the caller function to the called function through the parenthesis as the variables used are local to the function. The value of the variable &lsquo;line&rsquo; is internal to the caller function.
Whereas when we consider the case of external variables ,the situation changes. Consider the case of declaring variables externally:
**#include</p>

<h1>define MAXLINE 100</h1>

<p>char line[MAXLINE];<em><em>       /</em>external variable declaration/</em></p>

<p>The variables line has been declared externally.
Hence the call and definition of the function ‘getline()’ could be modified as follows:
Function call:
<strong>getline()</strong>
Function definition:
<strong>int getline(void)
{
}</strong>
The modified values of the variables would be available to all the functions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>C provides a lot of built in functions. Apart from that users define their own functions knows as user-defines functions. The function has got three parts
The declaration,the call and the definition.
Consider a function<strong> &lsquo;getline&rsquo;</strong> which is used to obtain each line from the input.
The three parts of the function would be as follows:
Declaration:<strong>returntype getline(parameters);</strong>
call:<strong>getline(arguments);</strong>
definition:<strong>returntype getline(parameters)
{
declarations;
statements;
}</strong>
The function definition may well contain a &lsquo;return&rsquo; statement to transfer the control back to the caller function. In such cases the return type of the function must not be &lsquo;void&rsquo;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Certain basic features of the C programming language are written here.
A text stream is a sequence of characters.
The <strong>getchar() </strong>statement in C is used so to obtain the next character  from a text stream that is inputted by the user.
c=getchar()
assigns the input character to c
The type of c is declared to be int(when EOF case is used).
<strong>putchar&copy;</strong>
prints the character ,that has been inputted, on the terminal.
Now consider what happens when we enter a statement
<strong>putchar(c-&lsquo;0&rsquo;)</strong>
where c=getchar() and the character inputted is &lsquo;r&rsquo;.
The result is B.The reason for the result being obtained is the the automatic type conversion that is performed in C.
The type of &lsquo;0&rsquo; is char and is converted to int,which is the type of &lsquo;c&rsquo;.Hence the integer value of &lsquo;0&rsquo; is subtracted from the integer value of &lsquo;r&rsquo; (i.e 114-48=65)which is equal to the integer value of &lsquo;B&rsquo;.Hence we obtain the result as B.
Similar type conversions can be seen in C in different examples.
If an operator has one float and one integer as its operands ,then the integer will be automatically converted to float.
We express the decimal number 16 as a floating point constant as 16.0.The same number would be represented as an integer as 16.
If we perform 16.0-16,the integer operand (i.e 16)would automatically be converted into floating point.
<strong>The generalization of this is that a narrower operand is converted into a wider operand</strong>.
For eg int->float,float->double,double->long double etc&hellip;.</p>

<p>Now we again move onto the input/output portion.
Consider a limit for the input is up to the EOF(end of file)
read input upto end of file is reached.
We set the condition as
(<strong>c=getchar())!=EOF) </strong>****  .This implies that the characters are fetched onto &lsquo;c&rsquo; until the End of file is reached. EOF is an integer defined in  as -1.
The paranthesis in (c=getchar())!=EOF is quite important. Without the paranthesis c would obtain values &lsquo;0&rsquo; or &lsquo;1&rsquo; depending upon the character not being EOF .This is because the precedence of != is greater than that of the assignment operator(=).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The common  file system commands that would make a beginner get started with linux are the following:</p>

<p><strong>ls</strong>:command that lists all the files in the current directory
Variations in the use of the ls command would be found as the ls -l,ls -t&hellip;
<strong>cp source dest</strong>:command that is used to copy file &lsquo;source&rsquo; to file &lsquo;dest&rsquo;
<strong>mv source dest</strong>:moves the file &lsquo;source&rsquo; to file&#8217;dest&#8217;
<strong>rm files</strong>:command used to remove a particular file
These commands when invoked would be looked in the directory /usr/bin
To check the presence of the &lsquo;cp&rsquo; command use:
<strong>which cp</strong>
You would get back /usr/bin
There is a case where the use of a paricular command (say cp)would display in a message as follows
bash:cp command not found
Make use of the &lsquo;which&rsquo; command to see if the cp command is present in the directory
<strong>which cp</strong>
There might be no response
Therefore the coreutil package needs to be reinstalled
<strong>apt-get install coreutils &mdash;reinstall coreutils</strong>
This would fix the problem.
The other basic commands would include the commands for printing the text:
<strong>cat filename</strong>:
<strong>pr filename</strong>:</p>

<p>Directories in linux contain files and subdirectories.Each user will be having his own home directory to whih he logs in at the beginning of a session.The user may then move on work in other directories which becomes his  current directory.</p>

<p>The basic commands that are used in regard with the directories include the following</p>

<p><strong>mkdir dirname:</strong>creates a new directory
<strong>cd dirname:</strong>change to the particular directory(provided that you are in the correct place)
To check whether you are in the correct place use
<strong>pwd</strong>
You would get back the &lsquo;current directory&rsquo;
<strong>cd ..</strong>: is used to go the previous directory.
<strong>cd</strong>: moves to the home directory.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Shell -the command interpreter.
There are many basic facilities offered by the shell.They include</p>

<p>1)Using shorthands for files(use of the asterisk &lsquo;<em>&rsquo;)
For example the command
<strong>pr temp</strong></em>
would print the contents of all files beginning with &lsquo;temp&rsquo;
Similarly the echo command
<strong>echo </strong>*
will list all the files in the current directory</p>

<p>2)Input-Output redirection
Consider the case where we want to list the files of the directory but not in the terminal
So we redirect it to a file using the &lsquo;>&rsquo; operator
<strong>ls > filename
</strong>If the file &lsquo;filename &rsquo; is not already created it will be so,or else it will be overwritten.
Counting the number of lines in a particular directory is done as
<strong>ls >filename
wc -l&lt;tfilename</strong></p>

<p>3)Inorder to avoid the creation of a temporary file,PIPES are used for the input-output redirection
The vertical bar &lsquo;|&rsquo; is the pipe.
Instead of using
ls>filename
wc -l&lt;filename
we use
<strong>ls|wc -l </strong>
for the redirection to be possible.</p>

<p>4)Tailoring the environment
As a user of UNIX,we could customize it in the way comfortable to us.
The &lsquo;stty&rsquo; command helps us do that
for eg:
<strong>stty erase &lsquo;^h&rsquo;
</strong>enables the user to use ctrl-h for erasing a particluar character.
By storing it in the file .profile (present in the home directory),we need not type it each time we login
One of the most important tailoring comes during the setting up of paths
Again this could be made changed in the <strong>&lsquo;.profile&rsquo; </strong>file.
The current path would enable searches in the directories /usr/bin and /bin.
If we did want to augment another directory to the search path we do it as follows:
<strong>PATH=export $PATH:/usr/games</strong>
where usr/games would be the newly added search directory.
The augmented path would be obtained using the &lsquo;echo&rsquo; command
<strong>echo $PATH
:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/games</strong>
All these changes could be saved into the file named &lsquo;.profile&rsquo;</p>
