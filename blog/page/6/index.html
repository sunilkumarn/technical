  <div class="entry-content"><p>Pointers as we know are used to store addresses. There is a strong relation between pointers and arrays in C.
Consider the following:
int <em>p;
int a[100];
p=NULL;
p=a;
Here p is initialized to the starting address of the array a[].This is equivalent to doing
p=&amp;a[0];
the statement p=a clearly shows the relation between pointers and arrays in C. Pointers and arrays can be used instead of each other in C although there are some differences that needs to be considered. We will find out the basics in comparing an array and a pointer.
Below a[] is an array and p is a pointer that has been initialized to the base address of the array.
a[i] is equivalent to doing </em>(p+i)
&amp;a[i] is equivalent to (p+i)-address of the i-th location of the array.
p=a as we saw just above is valid, whereas a=p is illegal.
Pointers are considered as normal variables and can be the increment operators, p++, whereas a++ is illegal.</p>

<p>Now consider the case of characters. Again let the variables have the same meaning,&lsquo;a[]&rsquo; for an array and &lsquo;p&rsquo; for a pointer.
Consider
char a[size]=”hello”;      This can be written using pointers as
char <em>p=”hello”;
Here p is initialized to the starting address of the string “hello”(to the character &lsquo;h&rsquo;).
Now obviously the difference comes here while printing.
printf(“%s”,a) would result in printing of the string whereas printf(“%s”,</em>p) would result in a segfault (obviously not due to uninitialized dereferencing) but because of the fact that the pointer points to the starting of the string(a character).
Hence it should be printed using
printf(“%c”,*p)  -would print the character .
This will be have to be looped if the entire string is to printed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What will we do if we need to store more than one string in an array.?
Double dimensional would be an option. For eg.
<strong>char array[][10]={&ldquo;hello&rdquo;,&ldquo;hai&rdquo;,&ldquo;how&rdquo;};</strong> But here the the length of each string is be limited up to 10..Specifying the &lsquo;column&rsquo; is a must in case of 2dimensional arrays. Even during the definition of a function.</p>

<p>Another option and perhaps a better one would be the use of pointers arrays .for e.g
<strong>char *p[]={&ldquo;hello&rdquo;,&ldquo;how&rdquo;,&ldquo;hai&rdquo;};</strong>
This is an example of pointer arrays. Each element of the array is used to keep pointers that point to some characters.  This method would be better in sense that the strings can be of variable lengths and obviously working with it can be a lot easier.
It will be interesting to find out the working of pointer arrays.</p>

<p>Consider a pointer &lsquo;p1&rsquo; such that :
char <em>p1=”hello”
Now this particular pointer can be entered into the pointer array like the following:
p[0]=p1;    The pointer to string “hello” is entered into the 0th position of the pointer array.
Similarly the pointer array can be filled with pointers to characters.
Now in order to print a particular string whose pointer is stored in the 0th location of the pointer array we need to do.
**&lsquo;printf(“%s”,p[0]); or printf(“”%s”,</em>(p+0));<strong>.    Both of them would give the result as hello&rsquo;.
</strong>printf(“%d”,p[0])**; would give the pointer that is stored in the 0-th location of the array.</p>

<p><strong>for(i=0;i&lt;3;i++)
printf(“%d\n”,p+i);</strong>     would show you the addresses of the array locations.</p>

<p>Pointer arrays would be very useful when playing with strings. Suppose if you want to sort different words according to their length. All you need to do if you have stored the pointers to those words in a pointer array is to exchange the positions of the pointers.
That is , if the string whose pointer at position &lsquo;0&rsquo; is greater than that of the string at position &lsquo;1&rsquo;, then
<strong>temp=a[0];
a[0]=a[1];
a[1]=temp;</strong>
Thats it..the pointers have exchanged their positions..Now on printing, the string whose pointer is stored at location &lsquo;0&rsquo; of the array &lsquo;a[]&rsquo; will be printed first.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It might have happened to that you that you unintentionally deleted some files in your directory. The deleted files may be not recovered back. So its better that you take some precautionary measures to avoid making such mistakes. Setting up proper aliases is one such way to so so. Aliases are short names for certain commands.</p>

<p>In order to set up your alias ,create a .bashrc file in your own home directory.
$ vi .bashrc
Set up your own aliases there.</p>

<p>Aliases for not making mistakes while using the cp,mv and rm commands are follows.</p>

<p> **14 alias rm=&lsquo;rm -i&rsquo;</p>

<p> 15 alias cp=&lsquo;cp -i&rsquo;</p>

<p> 16 alias mv=&lsquo;mv -i&rsquo;**</p>

<p>These three statements ensure that whenever you the commands cp,mv or rm ,the system asks you to double check your decision just to make sure that is exactly what you wanted to do. This could help you against overwriting a file,or deleting a file unintentionally.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When a particular sequence of commands is repeated time after ,it might be better if we create a shorter command of our own. These command creation mentioned may not be suitable for public use but would be helpful for private use.</p>

<p>Consider suppose that we intend to count the number of users quite frequently:
<strong>$ who|wc -l</strong></p>

<p>We can make a small command of ours named &lsquo;count&rsquo; that does the same work.
So we do
<strong>$echo &lsquo;who|wc -l&rsquo;>count</strong> (A file named &lsquo;count&rsquo; is created).</p>

<p>Now we run the shell program with its input coming from the file &lsquo;count&rsquo;.
<strong>$ sh&lt;count</strong>
this is same as
<strong>$ sh count</strong></p>

<p>Now to type sh all the time wouldn&rsquo;t be such a great thing. So we make the file &lsquo;count&rsquo; executable by
<strong>$ chmod +x count</strong>
Now the result of doing &lsquo;who|wc -l&rsquo; can be produced by doing &lsquo;count&rsquo;.
<strong>$ count</strong>
Install count ,place it in the /usr/bin directory. Set the path appropriately and start using the command
created.</p>

<p>Now again when we begin to create executable commands of our own, we will have to make it executable . So it would be better if we create a shorter command for <strong>chmod +x filename</strong>.
The problem here would be that the filename that is passed to &lsquo;chmod&rsquo; may change every time.
Therefore we do
<strong>$ echo &lsquo;chmod +x $1&rsquo;>cx</strong> (cx would be the file created).</p>

<p>Here $1-indicates that only 1 argument can be passed to the command at a time</p>

<pre><code>     $2 would make it 2 and $9 would make it 9.
</code></pre>

<p>So to enable any number of arguments we do
<strong>$ echo &lsquo;chmod +x $*&rsquo;>cx</strong></p>

<p>Now we need to make cx executable.
This can be done either by doing
<strong>$ chmod +x cx</strong>       or else
<strong>$ sh cx cx </strong>             because sh cx is equivalent to doing chmod +x $*.
Now test it by creating a test command &lsquo;test&rsquo; ,install it and run the command. &lsquo;Permission denied&rsquo; will be the message. Now do
<strong>$ cx test</strong>
<strong>$ test</strong>
The command &lsquo;test&rsquo; will run and the result will be produced.</p>

<p>Now suppose we have a file &lsquo;class&rsquo; consisting of some information about the students of our class and consider a case where we need information about certain students  and  we need it quite frequently. This can be done with the help of the &lsquo;grep&rsquo; command.
<strong>$ echo &lsquo;grep $* /root/new/class&rsquo;> find</strong>
install the command.
<strong>$ cx find</strong>              /* makes the file executable
<strong>$ find</strong></p>

<p>Now a possible would arise when the following case is given as the argument:
$ find sunil kumar
This is because the words sunil and kumar will be seen as two different arguments.
Hence do
<strong>$ echo &lsquo;grep “$*” /root/new/class&rsquo;> find</strong>
This would solve the problem.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While writing C programs using the &lsquo;vi&rsquo; editor ,you might find a frustrating task of handling with line numbers ,setting up the indentation properly and of course you might never mind if some indications are given about the keywords using colors. There fore we set up the vim configuration and automate the above said tasks by doing the following.
Create a file .exrc in your home directory..
vi .exrc   &hellip;.filename ending with rc indicates that you can configure them the way you want it to be.
Now type the following:
<strong>set nu</strong>             /<em>to set up line numbers properly</em>/
<strong>set cindent </strong>     /<em>to set up the indentation(for the better clarity of the program)</em>/
<strong>syntax on</strong>        /<em>this sets the coloring &lsquo;on&rsquo; for the program according to the C syntax </em>/
Now save the file and start writing your programs more comfortably.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Segmentation fault occurs when an attempt is made to access unallocated memory.
Segmentation faults with pointers might prove to be a task to deal with .This is mainly because of the fact that the actual area of the fault has to be identified and then the fault cleared. This might sometimes leave you in a pondering state. If the reasons that cause the segmentation faults are known , then it might help us to get rid of it quite quickly&hellip;
The major reasons for the segmentation fault to occur while using pointers might be the following..
Dereferencing NULL
and dereferencing an uninitialized pointer.
Both these cases would result in segmentation fault.</p>

<p>Whenever a segmentation fault occurs-the best way to deal with it is to find out the point of occurrence at first and then find out exactly why it happened..
The best way to spot a segmentation fault is to install gdb on your system.
This would enable you to find out the point of occurrence of the fault and the fault can be cleared.
The best practice while using pointers is always to<strong> initialize the pointer to NULL at first</strong>. Therefore when using the gdb you can see the null value( as 0x0 in systems)
<em><em>/</em>  consider a section of the debugging process</em>/</p>

<p>51  <em>dayofmonth=yearday;
(gdb) s
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x0804862f in year_day (year=12, yearday=15, <em>dayofmonth=0x0, month=0x0</em>) at pmonthday.c:51
51  </em>dayofmonth=yearday;</p>

<p>*/**</p>

<p>Here my pointers are &lsquo;dayofmonth&rsquo; and &lsquo;month&rsquo;..Hence from the debugging process its clear that the pointers have been set to NULL which indicates that we have not initialized the pointer to a legal memory address.
Again there are other methods identify the problem. Print all the values of pointers used in the program and see if any value differs from the others by a far long distance. If yes,this address space might be illegal. But theres no guarantee that this would be a solution.
Of course it may happen that sometimes you might get lucky with uninitialized pointers and there might be no segmentation fault, but its better not to make a habit of that because you might a segfault anytime. Hence its always better to initialize the pointer to NULL at first and then to a legal address.
A segmentation fault could be cleared by just setting the pointer to some legal address.
For an eg..
&lsquo;p&rsquo; is the uninitialized pointer that has caused the fault, just set it to the base address of an array as
char array[1000];
char *p=array;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The static declaration can be applied to both external and internal variables. The static declaration if applied to external variables limits the scope of that particular variable to the rest of the source file being compiled. Static declaration if applied to the internal variables ensures that the variables returns its previous value after the control has been transferred out and in of the particular function&hellip;i.e it provides permanent storage for the variable rather than temporary storage which is the case with normal internal variables.</p>

<p>Lets see how static works with internal variables&hellip;
Consider the program code&hellip;</p>

<p>char yes(void)
{</p>

<pre><code>static int lastc=0;
lastc=lastc+1;
return lastc;
</code></pre>

<p>}
The variable lastc has been declared static:
Hence the value of lastc remains intact even after the function &lsquo;yes()&rsquo; has terminted&hellip;lastc will get back its older value when the next call to the function &lsquo;yes()&#8217;arrives.
Therefore if the return values where to be printed&hellip;it would be as following:
1
2
3
&hellip;
&hellip;</p>

<p>This obviously wouldn&rsquo;t have been the case if the static declaration was not provided.
Now consider the case:</p>

<p>char yes(void)
{</p>

<pre><code>static int lastc;
lastc=0;
lastc=lastc+1;
return lastc;
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>Here the initial value of the variable has been assigned after the static declaration is performed.
This would result in a normal execution. Obviously the variable would be static and has permanent storage but its that just the assignment operation after the static declaration takes its effect. Therefore its highly important to initialize the value of the variable declared &lsquo;static&rsquo; along with declaration.</p>

printd(12/10);</p>

<p>printd(1)               //level 3
1/10 is not true;
hence putchar(1%10+&lsquo;0&rsquo;);        //1 is printed
}</p>

<p>Now the call to the completed function printd(1) came from the function printd(12/10)(level 2)  and the control returns to the end of the function printd(12/10) (n being 12)
The next statement is
hence putchar(12%10+&lsquo;0&rsquo;);       // 2 is printed</p>

<p>Again the call to the completed function .i.e (printd(12)) is not from the main, but its from the function printd(123/10)(level 3) and hence the control is returned to the end of the function(n being 123).
The next statement is
hence putchar(123%10+&lsquo;0&rsquo;);      // 3 is printed
Now the call to completed function(printd(123)) came from the main() and the control is returned there and the program proceeds.</p>

<p>Hope this gives a basic idea of the working of recursive functions. The function used in quick sort algorithm for sorting would be a good way to understand the working of recursion in a better way.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Before we get a view of the bitwise operators , its important to have an idea of  sizes of different types that are used in C.
Since most of the values that are entered by us can be accommodated by the ‘type float’ we consider the int , short and char types.
The data type char occupies a space of minimum of 8 bits(1 byte).The maximum value that can be placed in an unsigned char without the problem of truncation is 255. In case of unsigned char, this value moves to 127.The minimum value in signed char is -128.
The type int stores a maximum value of 65,635 for unsigned type and a maximum of 32767 for the signed type(these are the minimum values offered by any system, the actual limits may change on different systems). The minimum for the signed type would be -32768.The minimum number of bits required for storage would be 16. These values are the same for the type ‘short’.
These were some of the basics that were needed to get an idea about the bitwise operators. Obviously playing with the bits is a bit more difficult task than the higher level.
The bitwise operators are
&amp;-bitwise AND
|-bitwise OR
&lt;>-right shift
^-exclusive or
~-bitwise complement.</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;-left shift operators would be the best way to get an idea about the bitwise operators.
Consider doing the following
255&lt;&lt;2….the result would be 1020….255&lt;<3 would give you 2040…255<<4….would give you 4080….and so….
Lets see how this works….doing 255<<2 is equivalent to doing 255*2^2(here the ^ symbol stands for the ‘raise to’ operator….Similarly 255<<3 is equivalent to doing 255*2^3….
A smaller number would  help in understanding this.
Left shift operator shifts each bit of the character 2 places to the left. In the case 1<<2…would give 4 as the answer…
1(00000001)<<2=00000100(4)….This is how you obtain 4 as the answer.
Now the importance of the knowing the bit size of different types comes in here…
Suppose that the character 255 has been stored using variable of the type ‘char’…Now it is obvious that after shifting it to left, the result cannot be held by the type ‘char’ because the maximum value that can be stored in ‘type char’ is 255..Therefore it will have to be stored in the type whose size is greater then that of ‘char’.
.unsigned char s=255;
.s=s<<2;  wouldn't be correct.
We use the type 'int' to store the result...
.unsigned char s=255;
.int i=s<<2; is the right way to do it..
Similarly its also important to consider the limits of the signed and unsigned values when using the shift operators.
The attempt to shift more bits than is allotted would produce in a message as ‘>=width of the type’.
The other bitwise operators work on the bits as follows….</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><p>p  &mdash;&ndash;  shifts the bits p positions to the right…equivalent to dividing with 2<sup>p</sup>.
&lsquo;&amp;&rsquo;  &mdash;-result is 1 when any of the bits are 1…
^,|,~ all work in their own way….</p></blockquote></blockquote>
