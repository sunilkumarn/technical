  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here is a small introduction to the python programming language provided by considering some of its most important features.</p>

<p>a=[1,2,3]
The above statement assigns &lsquo;a&rsquo; to a list which is [1,2,3]
b=(1,2,3)
The statement assigns &lsquo;b&rsquo; to a tuple which is (1,2,3)
Lists and tuples are one of the most important features of python. They both are collection of values separated by &lsquo;commas&rsquo;(,). The difference between lists and tuples is that tuples are immutable(cannot be modified) whereas the value stored in a list can be changed and modified.
Lets see that with an example:
a[0]=10
&lsquo;a&rsquo; now becomes [10,2,3].
The above operation( I.e modification )cannot be performed with tuples).
b[0]=10 would produce an error message.</p>

<p>Lists can be manipulated in a number of interesting ways and the working of lists is also quite interesting.
 .a=[1,2,3].
 .b=a            would now make &lsquo;b&rsquo; [1,2,3]
Now any changes made to b, suppose
b[1]=20
would also result in &lsquo;a[1]&rsquo; being changed to &lsquo;20&rsquo;. This is a really important concept that has to be understood in python.
When <strong>b=a</strong> is done ,the statement makes &lsquo;b&rsquo; point to the same address where &lsquo;a&rsquo; points. Hence the changes applied to list &lsquo;b&rsquo; are reflected in &lsquo;a&rsquo; as well.
If the above case is to be avoided, there are basically two ways:
1)Pass the list &lsquo;a&rsquo; as a tuple to &lsquo;b&rsquo; so that it cannot be modified.
A list can be converted into a tuple using the &lsquo;tuple&rsquo; command: &lsquo;tuple(list)&rsquo;
2)Pass a clone of &lsquo;a&rsquo; to &lsquo;b&rsquo;. This can be done as b=a[:]. Here only a clone of &lsquo;a&rsquo; is passed to &lsquo;b&rsquo; thereby any changes made to &lsquo;b&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t affect &lsquo;a&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Manipulation of lists may be as:
a=[1,2,3,4,5]
a[1:3]
would give as [2,3]
a[1:]
would give [2,3,4,5]
a[:1]
the result would be [1]</p>

<p>There are a number of commands that can be applied on lists:They include the following:
&lsquo;append&rsquo;
a.append([10,2]) would give you &lsquo;a&rsquo; as [1,2,3,4,5[10,2]]</p>

<p>&lsquo;extend&rsquo;
a.extend([8,9]) would give us &lsquo;a&rsquo; as [1,2,3,4,5,[10,2],8,9]</p>

<p>&lsquo;pop&rsquo;
a.pop(4) would delete and return the element at the 4rth position.</p>

<p>&lsquo;insert&rsquo;
a.insert(2,10) would insert &lsquo;10&rsquo; at the 2nd position of the list..</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Consider the statements:</p>

<p>int c=5;
printf(&ldquo;\n%d\n&rdquo;,c++);
printf(&ldquo;\n%d\n&rdquo;,++c)</p>

<p>The result as we except would be :
5
7</p>

<p>Again consider the statement
printf(&ldquo;\n%d %d:\n&rdquo;,c++,++c);</p>

<p>Here the result wouldn&rsquo;t be as we thought and as is correct in the earlier example. When I executed this I obtained the result as:
6 7:
This is an undefined behaviour:Therefore its an important thing to keep in mind while using the increment/decrement operators:Its important &lsquo;not to&rsquo; increment/decrement the same object more than once in a statement.
If an object appears more than once in an expression ,then modifying the object in the expression without the previous value of the object taking part in the modification process will lead to undefined behaviour. Thats whats done in the example just above. The value of c is modified in the expression for the second time(there fore &lsquo;c&rsquo; appearing twice) without the previous value participating in the process. So if at all an object has to be modified in an expression where it appears more than once ,then it should be something like as follows:
c=c+1;
Here c appears twice , c is modified but the previous value of &lsquo;c&rsquo; takes part in the process..</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Consider the following statement:
<strong>char *lineptr[]={&ldquo;hello&rdquo;,&ldquo;hai&rdquo;,&ldquo;how&rdquo;};</strong>
Here &lsquo;lineptr&rsquo; is an array that consists of pointers to characters.
1)  Now this array is passed on to another function with a call as follows:
<strong>str(lineptr)</strong>;
The function &lsquo;str&rsquo; would have a declaration as follows:
<strong>void str(char *lineptr[]);</strong></p>

<p>2)  The same thing can be done in a different way as follows:
<strong>str((char </strong>) lineptr)<strong>;
The definition of &lsquo;str&rsquo; can be the same as the above or it could well be:
</strong>void str(char <strong>lineptr);</strong>(the declaration of the function could have been the same when the call was
str(lineptr); as well.
This is an example of a pointer to a pointer.</p>

<p>Here in our function call :str((char <strong>)lineptr);   we pass a pointer to a pointer (that points to characters).
And that we have as (char</strong>)lineptr.
This shows the thick relation between arrays and pointers in C. Any operation that can be done array   subscripting can also be done with pointers.
.char s[]=”hello”;
could be done using pointers as
.char *s=”hello”.</p>

<p><strong>The parenthesis and the type specification (char) that we have is extremely important. </strong>
Without the parenthesis and the type,it would be as follows:
**lineptr : dereferencing the dereferenced value of lineptr ,i.e,&amp;lineptr[0]  which would result in &lsquo;h&rsquo; as the answer.</p>

<p>In both cases
for(i=0;i&lt;3;i++)
printf(“%s”,*lineptr++);
would print out the contents of the array &lsquo;lineptr&rsquo; (.i.e (hellohaihow)).
.lineptr++ increments lineptr by  a value of 4 since it points to pointers.</p>

<p>Now consider another case ,
The function call being
<strong>str((char</strong>)lineptr) or str(lineptr)<strong><br/>
The declaration being
</strong>void str(char *ptr)**;
Through the function call, we pass a pointer to pointer(that points to characters).But the declaration consists of a pointer that points to characters. Therefore the variable &lsquo;ptr&rsquo; in the function &lsquo;str&rsquo; would take up the base address of the array &lsquo;lineptr&rsquo; as its value. Now since this a pointer that points to characters ,   ptr++ would increment &lsquo;ptr&rsquo; by a value of only 1.And since this points to some unknown characters, undefined results would be produced.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Pointers as we know are used to store addresses. There is a strong relation between pointers and arrays in C.
Consider the following:
int <em>p;
int a[100];
p=NULL;
p=a;
Here p is initialized to the starting address of the array a[].This is equivalent to doing
p=&amp;a[0];
the statement p=a clearly shows the relation between pointers and arrays in C. Pointers and arrays can be used instead of each other in C although there are some differences that needs to be considered. We will find out the basics in comparing an array and a pointer.
Below a[] is an array and p is a pointer that has been initialized to the base address of the array.
a[i] is equivalent to doing </em>(p+i)
&amp;a[i] is equivalent to (p+i)-address of the i-th location of the array.
p=a as we saw just above is valid, whereas a=p is illegal.
Pointers are considered as normal variables and can be the increment operators, p++, whereas a++ is illegal.</p>

<p>Now consider the case of characters. Again let the variables have the same meaning,&lsquo;a[]&rsquo; for an array and &lsquo;p&rsquo; for a pointer.
Consider
char a[size]=”hello”;      This can be written using pointers as
char <em>p=”hello”;
Here p is initialized to the starting address of the string “hello”(to the character &lsquo;h&rsquo;).
Now obviously the difference comes here while printing.
printf(“%s”,a) would result in printing of the string whereas printf(“%s”,</em>p) would result in a segfault (obviously not due to uninitialized dereferencing) but because of the fact that the pointer points to the starting of the string(a character).
Hence it should be printed using
printf(“%c”,*p)  -would print the character .
This will be have to be looped if the entire string is to printed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What will we do if we need to store more than one string in an array.?
Double dimensional would be an option. For eg.
<strong>char array[][10]={&ldquo;hello&rdquo;,&ldquo;hai&rdquo;,&ldquo;how&rdquo;};</strong> But here the the length of each string is be limited up to 10..Specifying the &lsquo;column&rsquo; is a must in case of 2dimensional arrays. Even during the definition of a function.</p>

<p>Another option and perhaps a better one would be the use of pointers arrays .for e.g
<strong>char *p[]={&ldquo;hello&rdquo;,&ldquo;how&rdquo;,&ldquo;hai&rdquo;};</strong>
This is an example of pointer arrays. Each element of the array is used to keep pointers that point to some characters.  This method would be better in sense that the strings can be of variable lengths and obviously working with it can be a lot easier.
It will be interesting to find out the working of pointer arrays.</p>

<p>Consider a pointer &lsquo;p1&rsquo; such that :
char <em>p1=”hello”
Now this particular pointer can be entered into the pointer array like the following:
p[0]=p1;    The pointer to string “hello” is entered into the 0th position of the pointer array.
Similarly the pointer array can be filled with pointers to characters.
Now in order to print a particular string whose pointer is stored in the 0th location of the pointer array we need to do.
**&lsquo;printf(“%s”,p[0]); or printf(“”%s”,</em>(p+0));<strong>.    Both of them would give the result as hello&rsquo;.
</strong>printf(“%d”,p[0])**; would give the pointer that is stored in the 0-th location of the array.</p>

<p><strong>for(i=0;i&lt;3;i++)
printf(“%d\n”,p+i);</strong>     would show you the addresses of the array locations.</p>

<p>Pointer arrays would be very useful when playing with strings. Suppose if you want to sort different words according to their length. All you need to do if you have stored the pointers to those words in a pointer array is to exchange the positions of the pointers.
That is , if the string whose pointer at position &lsquo;0&rsquo; is greater than that of the string at position &lsquo;1&rsquo;, then
<strong>temp=a[0];
a[0]=a[1];
a[1]=temp;</strong>
Thats it..the pointers have exchanged their positions..Now on printing, the string whose pointer is stored at location &lsquo;0&rsquo; of the array &lsquo;a[]&rsquo; will be printed first.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It might have happened to that you that you unintentionally deleted some files in your directory. The deleted files may be not recovered back. So its better that you take some precautionary measures to avoid making such mistakes. Setting up proper aliases is one such way to so so. Aliases are short names for certain commands.</p>

<p>In order to set up your alias ,create a .bashrc file in your own home directory.
$ vi .bashrc
Set up your own aliases there.</p>

<p>Aliases for not making mistakes while using the cp,mv and rm commands are follows.</p>

<p> **14 alias rm=&lsquo;rm -i&rsquo;</p>

<p> 15 alias cp=&lsquo;cp -i&rsquo;</p>

<p> 16 alias mv=&lsquo;mv -i&rsquo;**</p>

<p>These three statements ensure that whenever you the commands cp,mv or rm ,the system asks you to double check your decision just to make sure that is exactly what you wanted to do. This could help you against overwriting a file,or deleting a file unintentionally.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When a particular sequence of commands is repeated time after ,it might be better if we create a shorter command of our own. These command creation mentioned may not be suitable for public use but would be helpful for private use.</p>

<p>Consider suppose that we intend to count the number of users quite frequently:
<strong>$ who|wc -l</strong></p>

<p>We can make a small command of ours named &lsquo;count&rsquo; that does the same work.
So we do
<strong>$echo &lsquo;who|wc -l&rsquo;>count</strong> (A file named &lsquo;count&rsquo; is created).</p>

<p>Now we run the shell program with its input coming from the file &lsquo;count&rsquo;.
<strong>$ sh&lt;count</strong>
this is same as
<strong>$ sh count</strong></p>

<p>Now to type sh all the time wouldn&rsquo;t be such a great thing. So we make the file &lsquo;count&rsquo; executable by
<strong>$ chmod +x count</strong>
Now the result of doing &lsquo;who|wc -l&rsquo; can be produced by doing &lsquo;count&rsquo;.
<strong>$ count</strong>
Install count ,place it in the /usr/bin directory. Set the path appropriately and start using the command
created.</p>

<p>Now again when we begin to create executable commands of our own, we will have to make it executable . So it would be better if we create a shorter command for <strong>chmod +x filename</strong>.
The problem here would be that the filename that is passed to &lsquo;chmod&rsquo; may change every time.
Therefore we do
<strong>$ echo &lsquo;chmod +x $1&rsquo;>cx</strong> (cx would be the file created).</p>

<p>Here $1-indicates that only 1 argument can be passed to the command at a time</p>

<pre><code>     $2 would make it 2 and $9 would make it 9.
</code></pre>

<p>So to enable any number of arguments we do
<strong>$ echo &lsquo;chmod +x $*&rsquo;>cx</strong></p>

<p>Now we need to make cx executable.
This can be done either by doing
<strong>$ chmod +x cx</strong>       or else
<strong>$ sh cx cx </strong>             because sh cx is equivalent to doing chmod +x $*.
Now test it by creating a test command &lsquo;test&rsquo; ,install it and run the command. &lsquo;Permission denied&rsquo; will be the message. Now do
<strong>$ cx test</strong>
<strong>$ test</strong>
The command &lsquo;test&rsquo; will run and the result will be produced.</p>

<p>Now suppose we have a file &lsquo;class&rsquo; consisting of some information about the students of our class and consider a case where we need information about certain students  and  we need it quite frequently. This can be done with the help of the &lsquo;grep&rsquo; command.
<strong>$ echo &lsquo;grep $* /root/new/class&rsquo;> find</strong>
install the command.
<strong>$ cx find</strong>              /* makes the file executable
<strong>$ find</strong></p>

<p>Now a possible would arise when the following case is given as the argument:
$ find sunil kumar
This is because the words sunil and kumar will be seen as two different arguments.
Hence do
<strong>$ echo &lsquo;grep “$*” /root/new/class&rsquo;> find</strong>
This would solve the problem.</p>

Create a file .exrc in your home directory..
vi .exrc   &hellip;.filename ending with rc indicates that you can configure them the way you want it to be.
Now type the following:
<strong>set nu</strong>             /<em>to set up line numbers properly</em>/
<strong>set cindent </strong>     /<em>to set up the indentation(for the better clarity of the program)</em>/

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Segmentation fault occurs when an attempt is made to access unallocated memory.
Segmentation faults with pointers might prove to be a task to deal with .This is mainly because of the fact that the actual area of the fault has to be identified and then the fault cleared. This might sometimes leave you in a pondering state. If the reasons that cause the segmentation faults are known , then it might help us to get rid of it quite quickly&hellip;
The major reasons for the segmentation fault to occur while using pointers might be the following..
Dereferencing NULL
and dereferencing an uninitialized pointer.
Both these cases would result in segmentation fault.</p>

<p>Whenever a segmentation fault occurs-the best way to deal with it is to find out the point of occurrence at first and then find out exactly why it happened..
The best way to spot a segmentation fault is to install gdb on your system.
This would enable you to find out the point of occurrence of the fault and the fault can be cleared.
The best practice while using pointers is always to<strong> initialize the pointer to NULL at first</strong>. Therefore when using the gdb you can see the null value( as 0x0 in systems)
<em><em>/</em>  consider a section of the debugging process</em>/</p>

<p>51  <em>dayofmonth=yearday;
(gdb) s
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x0804862f in year_day (year=12, yearday=15, <em>dayofmonth=0x0, month=0x0</em>) at pmonthday.c:51
51  </em>dayofmonth=yearday;</p>

<p>*/**</p>

<p>Here my pointers are &lsquo;dayofmonth&rsquo; and &lsquo;month&rsquo;..Hence from the debugging process its clear that the pointers have been set to NULL which indicates that we have not initialized the pointer to a legal memory address.
Again there are other methods identify the problem. Print all the values of pointers used in the program and see if any value differs from the others by a far long distance. If yes,this address space might be illegal. But theres no guarantee that this would be a solution.
Of course it may happen that sometimes you might get lucky with uninitialized pointers and there might be no segmentation fault, but its better not to make a habit of that because you might a segfault anytime. Hence its always better to initialize the pointer to NULL at first and then to a legal address.
A segmentation fault could be cleared by just setting the pointer to some legal address.
For an eg..
&lsquo;p&rsquo; is the uninitialized pointer that has caused the fault, just set it to the base address of an array as
char array[1000];
char *p=array;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The static declaration can be applied to both external and internal variables. The static declaration if applied to external variables limits the scope of that particular variable to the rest of the source file being compiled. Static declaration if applied to the internal variables ensures that the variables returns its previous value after the control has been transferred out and in of the particular function&hellip;i.e it provides permanent storage for the variable rather than temporary storage which is the case with normal internal variables.</p>

<p>Lets see how static works with internal variables&hellip;
Consider the program code&hellip;</p>

<p>char yes(void)
{</p>

<pre><code>static int lastc=0;
lastc=lastc+1;
return lastc;
</code></pre>

<p>}
The variable lastc has been declared static:
Hence the value of lastc remains intact even after the function &lsquo;yes()&rsquo; has terminted&hellip;lastc will get back its older value when the next call to the function &lsquo;yes()&#8217;arrives.
Therefore if the return values where to be printed&hellip;it would be as following:
1
2
3
&hellip;
&hellip;</p>

<p>This obviously wouldn&rsquo;t have been the case if the static declaration was not provided.
Now consider the case:</p>

<p>char yes(void)
{</p>

<pre><code>static int lastc;
lastc=0;
lastc=lastc+1;
return lastc;
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>Here the initial value of the variable has been assigned after the static declaration is performed.
This would result in a normal execution. Obviously the variable would be static and has permanent storage but its that just the assignment operation after the static declaration takes its effect. Therefore its highly important to initialize the value of the variable declared &lsquo;static&rsquo; along with declaration.</p>
