  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Shebang</strong>(also known as &lsquo;hashbang&rsquo;) refers to the characters #! when they are the first two characters (occurring at the left most corner, i.e the beginning of the very first line) of your script. The particular line that contains the shebang is the shebang line in your script.
Now what&rsquo;s shebang meant to do.?
In a unix-like operating system , <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loader_(computing">the program loader</a>) (part of the operating system thats responsible for loading programs) finds the presence of these two characters(#!) , identifies it as a script and tries to execute it with the interpreter that will be specified using the remaining lines of the script.
For example consider writing a shebang line for a python script..
First and foremost you need to find the location of the interpreter for that particular script&hellip;
<strong>$which python
/usr/bin/python</strong>
Therefore&hellip;the shebang line should be set as&hellip;
<strong>#! /usr/bin/python</strong>
Specifying the shebang line would execute your script as follows:
./&lsquo;script name&rsquo;.py       instead of doing     &lsquo;python &#8216;script name&rsquo;.py&#8217;
You could try out the use of shebang lines for any of the following types of scripts
&lsquo;werbel&rsquo;, &lsquo;tinypy&rsquo; ,&lsquo;perl&rsquo;&hellip;..and many more&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><pre><code>    Compare python with some of the other languages that are familiar to many of you. The obvious difference that will be caught by you , is the fact that python code, for the same program ,is much shorter than codes written in some of your favorite languages like C ,Java etc.
</code></pre>

<p>Understanding the essence of python programming would help you write shorter and interesting codes  and are easier to understand. Lets just have a look into some of the core points that need to be followed so that your python program becomes short and effective.</p>

<pre><code>    First and foremost, you need to understand the fact that python has got a huge library with functions for almost every activity you would need frequently. The only thing you need to do is to identify whether a function is present that would handle your case and then call the function .There are lots of built in functions that we could call. Other functions that reside in certain modules can also be invoked after the module containing the function has been imported.
</code></pre>

<p> As an example , consider the following:</p>

<pre><code>        **map(sqr,range(1,100)):**

    'map' is a built -in higher order function that takes two or more arguments and returns you a list,'range' is another built-in which would return a list containing all the elements from the starting element up to the ending element.

    This particular function returns a list of squares of all numbers from 1 up to 99 using a single line code. Compare this to a C code to find the squares of this many numbers,certainly ,a single line code wouldn't do that for you.

    Python has got a large collection of such built ins which includes functions like 'filter','reduce','hex','cmp' and many more.

    Python has got many more functions that are defined in different modules:To use those functions , you just need to import those modules and invoke them. Some of the most commonly invoked ones are :
    **Module 're**' for pattern matching. Contains power full functions like findall' , search' , 'match' etc.
    **Module 'os'** for operating system services. Includes functions 'mkdir' , 'chdir' ,' path.join,' path.abspath'' etc.
    **Module 'shutil'** for shell utilities like copying files.

    **Module 'urllib'** for dealing with 'URLs'.

    **Module 'sys**' :sys.argv[index] would return the input given on the command line at position 'index.'

    Identifying the correct functions that are present in these and more modules in python  would result in much shorter code length. 

 A proper knowledge about the use of sequences and variables would do no harm in our purpose of decreasing the code size.

Consider the code to swap the values of two variables. In other languages you would write:
temp=a:
a=b:
b=temp:

Once again, in python all you need is a single line code :

**a,b=b,a**
</code></pre>

<p> The logic behind whats happening is to be understood. Consider the right hand side of the expression -variables are packed into a tuple. On the left hand side, the tuple is unpacked and the values are entered into the variables. Thus the values are swapped in a single line as opposed to three lines taken in other languages.</p>

<pre><code>Use of generator expressions is another way to reduce your code size.
Consider:
xvec=[10,20,30]
yvec=[30,40,50]
</code></pre>

<p>The expression <strong>sum(x*y for x,y in zip(xvec,yvec)) </strong>gives you the dot product of xvec and yvec in a single step where &lsquo;sum&rsquo; is another built in function. Think of writing a C code instead of this and the number of writing you would take.</p>

<pre><code>There are many more such tricks that would decrease the code size considerably . Slicing of lists , usage of the appropriate sequences are all important in producing a short and elegant code. Obviously,the fact remains that to understand the methodology behind decreasing the code size is to keep on coding ,understanding the definitions of the functions and identifying where to use them. But again, compressing your code size heavily might result in your code being hard to digest by others, specially those beginners trying to understand a python code. Therefore its important to develop a skill where you would maintain a balance between decreasing the code size and the readability of your code. This can be achieved only through rigorous coding.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In C, once the memory allocated becomes garbage , that chunk of memory is gone wasted. Nothing more is possible on it.
Consider
<strong>int a[10];</strong>
Some amount of memory would be allocated for the array &lsquo;a&rsquo;. Now if do a=&lsquo;some value&rsquo; , the memory that was allocated to the array becomes garbage because &lsquo;a&rsquo; no longer uses it as it is pointing to something else now. The memory is gone wasted and is no more usable.
The bugs that create loss of memory are hard to detect as well ,simply because of the fact that they cannot be seen. Its only after executing the particular code for some amount of times that you might actually get to see the effects of the bug .By the time your system may have crashed.</p>

<p>In python ,the interpreter is smart enough to do &lsquo;garbage collection&rsquo;. That is the memory which is unused is collected by the interpreter and is not gone wasted. The process of garbage collection is done by using a method called ref counting. Understand ref counting as :
<strong>Consider a=[1,2,3]</strong>
&lsquo;a&rsquo; points to a particular block of memory. At the end of the block of memory ,there would be a count that indicates the number of variables that point to the same block of memory. So now the count would be 1.</p>

<p>Now if we do,</p>

<p>b=a&hellip;&hellip;means that now b points to same block of memory. Therefore the count becomes 2.</p>

<p>Now consider doing</p>

<p>b=0.</p>

<p>The count in the block of memory where b was pointing earlier reduces by 1. , hence count is now 1.
Do</p>

<p>&lsquo;a=0&rsquo;</p>

<p>and the count in that block becomes 0.Now the python interpreter can allot the chunk of memory to some other variable as it may feel. The significant thing that you need to understand is the fact that the memory is not gone wasted as in C .</p>

<p>Garbage collection keeps track of the variables that point to a block of memory and collects the unused memory accordingly. There is never a shortage of memory space. But there are obvious disadvantages with the process of garbage collection.</p>

<p>One drawback , as you would except would be the matter of speed which would decrease.
But the more significant drawback would be the <strong>non-deterministic behavior</strong> of the interpreter.
Consider the two statements.
 .i=0
 .j=0
You would expect the statement j=0 to be executed immediately after the statement i=0 has been executed. But as a result of this process of garbage collection ,this is not a guarantee. There might be a certain time delay in executing the second statement if the interpreter feels like doing some &lsquo;garbage collection&rsquo; after the first statement has been executed . This results in the delay.</p>

<p>Therefore its clear that its not best to use python over languages like C when it comes to real time systems.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Consider the function definition:

<p>Here the function &lsquo;mapp&rsquo; consists of three arguments passed to it. Out of this ,the third argument (second) is the arbitrary argument list. The argument is itself optional and can be passed with different lists or tuples ranging from zero to any number of lists.
The length of the arbitrary listed argument would be zero if no arguments are passed to it.(len(second)=0).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><pre><code>Coming from C ,a programming language where you might come across lot of un-expectencies while coding, python might be termed as 'lot easier' to deal with for a beginner especially. For those who have programmed in C,python provides you with the great advantage of 'not' having to get into the system specifications such as 'memory and bit' manipulations. Ask those C programmers who would always say that the biggest challenge they have come across in C as a beginner is while they have dealt with pointers as if they are being taunted . Luckily ,specially for the starters ,python doesn't require you to get into the memory allocation details and other stuff. All you need to do is to write your efficient code and wait for the result and most of the time the output you get wont give you a shock.

You could create a long list of points that might attract you to do a bit of coding in Python although C obviously has its own standouts. Some of them may be noted.

Python follows the Object oriented Programming paradigm whereas C follows Imperative programming paradigm.

Python has got a really large library as compared to C and a huge number of really powerful and useful built in functions.

Python code ,at first sight looks a lot more tidy than C because of its compulsory indentation requirement. You might know that this is not a necessity in C.

Python codes can be slower than corresponding C codes. Because python performs an 'out-of-range' checking for each iteration while looping ,the code becomes a lot more slower. This check has its own advantage though. Programmers in C would no that trying to access a location outside the allocation of an array would cause disastrous results.Python also performs the process of [garbage collection](http://sunilkumarn.wordpress.com/2010/09/02/garbage-collection-in-python/) which again decreases the execution speed.

The use of 'for loop' in Python is entirely different from that in C. The variable used is auto incremented and its important not to try and modify the loop variable of the 'for' loop.

There are no type declarations in python as is necessary in C.

    Python does not support in-line assignment as in C. Therefore there is no chance of accidently assigning the value to a variable that you thought you were comparing.i.e 'if a=5' would just produce an error in Python whereas in C this would make the value of a equal to 5.

One of the major differences between python and C is that you wont get to play with pointers in python. Memory manipulation by the programmer is not required in Python as in C. Almost all the such activities done in C with the use of pointers can be done with sequences and associative arrays in python.

The variables used in python would result in an error without making an appropriate assignment. This proves really beneficial because unassigned variables can trouble you leading even up to segmentation faults in C.

Implementation of the 'stack' data structure becomes a lot more easier in python than in C. The implementation of 'queue' also becomes relatively easier. The python built-ins ;insert','append' etc helps in the purpose.

Another important feature of python is the use of sequences 'lists' , 'tuples',strings' and the use of Associative arrays. and their different manipulations. This helps programmers to do almost anything that can imagine of with the data stored.

Most importantly, python code is a lot more short than its  corresponding C code. Programs that may take up to a few lines in a normal C code would give you the result in about 1-2 lines of coding in Python.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here is a small introduction to the python programming language provided by considering some of its most important features.</p>

<p>a=[1,2,3]
The above statement assigns &lsquo;a&rsquo; to a list which is [1,2,3]
b=(1,2,3)
The statement assigns &lsquo;b&rsquo; to a tuple which is (1,2,3)
Lists and tuples are one of the most important features of python. They both are collection of values separated by &lsquo;commas&rsquo;(,). The difference between lists and tuples is that tuples are immutable(cannot be modified) whereas the value stored in a list can be changed and modified.
Lets see that with an example:
a[0]=10
&lsquo;a&rsquo; now becomes [10,2,3].
The above operation( I.e modification )cannot be performed with tuples).
b[0]=10 would produce an error message.</p>

<p>Lists can be manipulated in a number of interesting ways and the working of lists is also quite interesting.
 .a=[1,2,3].
 .b=a            would now make &lsquo;b&rsquo; [1,2,3]
Now any changes made to b, suppose
b[1]=20
would also result in &lsquo;a[1]&rsquo; being changed to &lsquo;20&rsquo;. This is a really important concept that has to be understood in python.
When <strong>b=a</strong> is done ,the statement makes &lsquo;b&rsquo; point to the same address where &lsquo;a&rsquo; points. Hence the changes applied to list &lsquo;b&rsquo; are reflected in &lsquo;a&rsquo; as well.
If the above case is to be avoided, there are basically two ways:
1)Pass the list &lsquo;a&rsquo; as a tuple to &lsquo;b&rsquo; so that it cannot be modified.
A list can be converted into a tuple using the &lsquo;tuple&rsquo; command: &lsquo;tuple(list)&rsquo;
2)Pass a clone of &lsquo;a&rsquo; to &lsquo;b&rsquo;. This can be done as b=a[:]. Here only a clone of &lsquo;a&rsquo; is passed to &lsquo;b&rsquo; thereby any changes made to &lsquo;b&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t affect &lsquo;a&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Manipulation of lists may be as:
a=[1,2,3,4,5]
a[1:3]
would give as [2,3]
a[1:]
would give [2,3,4,5]
a[:1]
the result would be [1]</p>

<p>There are a number of commands that can be applied on lists:They include the following:
&lsquo;append&rsquo;
a.append([10,2]) would give you &lsquo;a&rsquo; as [1,2,3,4,5[10,2]]</p>

<p>&lsquo;extend&rsquo;
a.extend([8,9]) would give us &lsquo;a&rsquo; as [1,2,3,4,5,[10,2],8,9]</p>

<p>&lsquo;pop&rsquo;
a.pop(4) would delete and return the element at the 4rth position.</p>

<p>&lsquo;insert&rsquo;
a.insert(2,10) would insert &lsquo;10&rsquo; at the 2nd position of the list..</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Consider the statements:</p>

<p>int c=5;
printf(&ldquo;\n%d\n&rdquo;,c++);
printf(&ldquo;\n%d\n&rdquo;,++c)</p>

<p>The result as we except would be :
5
7</p>

<p>Again consider the statement
printf(&ldquo;\n%d %d:\n&rdquo;,c++,++c);</p>

<p>Here the result wouldn&rsquo;t be as we thought and as is correct in the earlier example. When I executed this I obtained the result as:
6 7:
This is an undefined behaviour:Therefore its an important thing to keep in mind while using the increment/decrement operators:Its important &lsquo;not to&rsquo; increment/decrement the same object more than once in a statement.
If an object appears more than once in an expression ,then modifying the object in the expression without the previous value of the object taking part in the modification process will lead to undefined behaviour. Thats whats done in the example just above. The value of c is modified in the expression for the second time(there fore &lsquo;c&rsquo; appearing twice) without the previous value participating in the process. So if at all an object has to be modified in an expression where it appears more than once ,then it should be something like as follows:
c=c+1;
Here c appears twice , c is modified but the previous value of &lsquo;c&rsquo; takes part in the process..</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Consider the following statement:
<strong>char *lineptr[]={&ldquo;hello&rdquo;,&ldquo;hai&rdquo;,&ldquo;how&rdquo;};</strong>
Here &lsquo;lineptr&rsquo; is an array that consists of pointers to characters.
1)  Now this array is passed on to another function with a call as follows:
<strong>str(lineptr)</strong>;
The function &lsquo;str&rsquo; would have a declaration as follows:
<strong>void str(char *lineptr[]);</strong></p>

<p>2)  The same thing can be done in a different way as follows:
<strong>str((char </strong>) lineptr)<strong>;
The definition of &lsquo;str&rsquo; can be the same as the above or it could well be:
</strong>void str(char <strong>lineptr);</strong>(the declaration of the function could have been the same when the call was
str(lineptr); as well.
This is an example of a pointer to a pointer.</p>

<p>Here in our function call :str((char <strong>)lineptr);   we pass a pointer to a pointer (that points to characters).
And that we have as (char</strong>)lineptr.
This shows the thick relation between arrays and pointers in C. Any operation that can be done array   subscripting can also be done with pointers.
.char s[]=”hello”;
could be done using pointers as
.char *s=”hello”.</p>

<p><strong>The parenthesis and the type specification (char) that we have is extremely important. </strong>
Without the parenthesis and the type,it would be as follows:
**lineptr : dereferencing the dereferenced value of lineptr ,i.e,&amp;lineptr[0]  which would result in &lsquo;h&rsquo; as the answer.</p>

<p>In both cases
for(i=0;i&lt;3;i++)
printf(“%s”,*lineptr++);
would print out the contents of the array &lsquo;lineptr&rsquo; (.i.e (hellohaihow)).
.lineptr++ increments lineptr by  a value of 4 since it points to pointers.</p>

<p>Now consider another case ,
The function call being
<strong>str((char</strong>)lineptr) or str(lineptr)<strong><br/>
The declaration being
</strong>void str(char *ptr)**;
Through the function call, we pass a pointer to pointer(that points to characters).But the declaration consists of a pointer that points to characters. Therefore the variable &lsquo;ptr&rsquo; in the function &lsquo;str&rsquo; would take up the base address of the array &lsquo;lineptr&rsquo; as its value. Now since this a pointer that points to characters ,   ptr++ would increment &lsquo;ptr&rsquo; by a value of only 1.And since this points to some unknown characters, undefined results would be produced.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Pointers as we know are used to store addresses. There is a strong relation between pointers and arrays in C.
Consider the following:
int <em>p;
int a[100];
p=NULL;
p=a;
Here p is initialized to the starting address of the array a[].This is equivalent to doing
p=&amp;a[0];
the statement p=a clearly shows the relation between pointers and arrays in C. Pointers and arrays can be used instead of each other in C although there are some differences that needs to be considered. We will find out the basics in comparing an array and a pointer.
Below a[] is an array and p is a pointer that has been initialized to the base address of the array.
a[i] is equivalent to doing </em>(p+i)
&amp;a[i] is equivalent to (p+i)-address of the i-th location of the array.
p=a as we saw just above is valid, whereas a=p is illegal.
Pointers are considered as normal variables and can be the increment operators, p++, whereas a++ is illegal.</p>

<p>Now consider the case of characters. Again let the variables have the same meaning,&lsquo;a[]&rsquo; for an array and &lsquo;p&rsquo; for a pointer.
Consider
char a[size]=”hello”;      This can be written using pointers as
char <em>p=”hello”;
Here p is initialized to the starting address of the string “hello”(to the character &lsquo;h&rsquo;).
Now obviously the difference comes here while printing.
printf(“%s”,a) would result in printing of the string whereas printf(“%s”,</em>p) would result in a segfault (obviously not due to uninitialized dereferencing) but because of the fact that the pointer points to the starting of the string(a character).
Hence it should be printed using
printf(“%c”,*p)  -would print the character .
This will be have to be looped if the entire string is to printed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What will we do if we need to store more than one string in an array.?
Double dimensional would be an option. For eg.
<strong>char array[][10]={&ldquo;hello&rdquo;,&ldquo;hai&rdquo;,&ldquo;how&rdquo;};</strong> But here the the length of each string is be limited up to 10..Specifying the &lsquo;column&rsquo; is a must in case of 2dimensional arrays. Even during the definition of a function.</p>

<p>Another option and perhaps a better one would be the use of pointers arrays .for e.g
<strong>char *p[]={&ldquo;hello&rdquo;,&ldquo;how&rdquo;,&ldquo;hai&rdquo;};</strong>
This is an example of pointer arrays. Each element of the array is used to keep pointers that point to some characters.  This method would be better in sense that the strings can be of variable lengths and obviously working with it can be a lot easier.
It will be interesting to find out the working of pointer arrays.</p>

<p>Consider a pointer &lsquo;p1&rsquo; such that :
char <em>p1=”hello”
Now this particular pointer can be entered into the pointer array like the following:
p[0]=p1;    The pointer to string “hello” is entered into the 0th position of the pointer array.
Similarly the pointer array can be filled with pointers to characters.
Now in order to print a particular string whose pointer is stored in the 0th location of the pointer array we need to do.
**&lsquo;printf(“%s”,p[0]); or printf(“”%s”,</em>(p+0));<strong>.    Both of them would give the result as hello&rsquo;.
</strong>printf(“%d”,p[0])**; would give the pointer that is stored in the 0-th location of the array.</p>

<p><strong>for(i=0;i&lt;3;i++)
printf(“%d\n”,p+i);</strong>     would show you the addresses of the array locations.</p>

<p>Pointer arrays would be very useful when playing with strings. Suppose if you want to sort different words according to their length. All you need to do if you have stored the pointers to those words in a pointer array is to exchange the positions of the pointers.
That is , if the string whose pointer at position &lsquo;0&rsquo; is greater than that of the string at position &lsquo;1&rsquo;, then
<strong>temp=a[0];
a[0]=a[1];
a[1]=temp;</strong>
Thats it..the pointers have exchanged their positions..Now on printing, the string whose pointer is stored at location &lsquo;0&rsquo; of the array &lsquo;a[]&rsquo; will be printed first.</p>
